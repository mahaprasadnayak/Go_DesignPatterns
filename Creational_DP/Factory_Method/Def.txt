Factory Method Design Pattern in Go-
---------------------------------------
-> It is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects specifying their concrete classes.


Encapsulates Object Creation – The object creation logic is moved to a dedicated method.

Encourages Code Reusability – Helps avoid repeating the same instantiation logic in multiple places.

Supports Open/Closed Principle – Easy to extend without modifying existing code.

Promotes Loose Coupling – The client code does not need to know the specific class it is working with.
